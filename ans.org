** Purpose
   - To determine weather using methods and tools of automata is a worthwhile approach to achieve an optimized development experience for game developers.

** Which systems should be designed using NFA
   - Critical systems that cannot fail, as it can be catastrophic.
   - In the embedded systems industy we use a term "Hard Real-Time" to define constraints for such systems.

** Which systems should not be designed using NFA
   
** The pros and cons of designing systems using NFA
   
** Are you planning to publish your work in a research conference
   
   - No.
   - I feel this project can use further refinement.
   - I believe the design decisions need to be discussed further.
